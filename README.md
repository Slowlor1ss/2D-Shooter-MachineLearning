# 2D-Shooter-MachineLearning

**Introduction**
---
While it has been done before, there has been less research in the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to <br>
modern computer games, besides from games like Doom, Minecraft, StarCraft, Tetris, and car racing games.<br>
More often reasearched using RL goes to robotics and multi-agent systems (MAS).<br>
Shooter games have some common features to these fields such as agents having the ability to sense and act to their<br>
surroundings, and complex continuous movements.<br>
Therefore I found the affects of RL in an 2D Shooter enviroment and interesting area to research.<br>
I will attempt to combine both RL and genetic algorithms (GA) and apply them to my 2D shootergame.<br>
A bot artificial intelligence (AI) generally consists of pathfinding, picking up and using items within<br>
the enviroment and different styles of combat.<br>
Bot AI in commercial games generally uses rule-based systems like, state machines, behaviour trees, etc. These<br>
techniques are typically time consuming and require fine-tuning of parameters. RL is an interesting algorithm to compete with these systems.<br>
RL could be applied with different parameters and used to generate different bots.<br>
<br>
The aim of this reasearch paper is to see how well i can use RL to learn a bot basic AI behaviours.<br>
To do this I will split the task up in to two mayor tasks one being navigation, exploring the enviroment and item collection.<br>
And the second task being the combat aspect.
