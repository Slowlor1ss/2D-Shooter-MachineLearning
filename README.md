# 2D-Shooter-MachineLearning

**Introduction**
---
While it has been done before In this research project I, there has been little research in the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) to modern computer games. More often reasearched using RL goes to robotics and multi-agent systems (MAS). 
Shooter games have some common features to these fields such as agents having the ability to sense and act to their
surroundigs, and complex continuous movements.
Therefore I found the affects of RL in an 2D Shooter enviroment and interesting area to research.
I will attempt to combine both RL and genetic algorithms (GA) and apply them to my 2D shootergame.
A bot artificial intelligence (AI) generally consists of pathfinding, picking up and using items within 
the enviroment and different styles of combat.
Bot AI in commercial games generally uses rule-based systems like, state machines, behaviour trees, etc. These
techniques are typically time consuming and require fine-tuning of parameters. RL is an interesting algorithm to compete with these systems.
RL could be applied with different parameters and used to generate different bots.

The aim of this reasearch paper is to see how well i can use RL to learn a bot basic AI behaviours. 
To do this I will split the task up in to two mayor tasks one being navigation, exploring the enviroment and item collection.
And the second task being the combat aspect.
